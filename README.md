# 🏠 Airbnb Price Prediction and Insights

## 📘 Overview

Airbnb allows property owners to rent their spaces to travelers. One of the biggest challenges for hosts is **setting the right price** — one that is competitive, yet profitable.

This project aims to build a **machine learning regression model** to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various features like:
- Property type
- Room type
- Location
- Number of reviews
- Amenities
- Host characteristics

By understanding which features influence price the most, the project also provides **data-driven insights** to help hosts optimize their pricing strategies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The goal is to:
- Develop a **regression model** that accurately predicts Airbnb listing prices.
- Analyze the **key drivers of price** and provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts and the platform itself.
- Improve **pricing recommendations** for better guest satisfaction and host profitability.
